    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>One night to be confused <br>
One night to speed up truth span <br>
We had a promise, babe <br>
Four hands and then away <br>
Both under influence <br>
We had divine sense <br>
To know what to say <br>
Mind is a razor blade <br>
To call for hands of above <br>
To lean on <br>
Wouldn't be good enough <br>
For me, no <br>
One night of magic rush <br>
The start a simple touch <br>
One night to push and scream <br>
And then relief <br>
Ten days of perfect hues <br>
The colors red and blue <br>
We had a promise, babe <br>
We were in love <br>
To call for hands of above <br>
To lean on <br>
Wouldn't be good enough <br>
For me, no <br>
To call for hands of above <br>
To lean on <br>
Wouldn't be good enough <br>
And you <br>
You knew the hand of the devil <br>
And you <br>
Kept us awake with wolves teeth <br>
Sharing different heartbeats <br>
In one night <br>
To call for hands of above <br>
To lean on <br>
Wouldn't be good enough <br>
For me, no <br>
To call for hands of above <br>
To lean on <br>
Wouldn't be good enough</p>
