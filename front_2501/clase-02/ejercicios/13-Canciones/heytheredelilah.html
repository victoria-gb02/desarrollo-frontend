    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there, if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise, I'm by your side
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you that by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same, and you're to blame
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history
Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you, this one's for you
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh</p>
