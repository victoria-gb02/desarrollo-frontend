    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Ooh <br>
Ooh, yeah <br>
Ooh <br>

Ooh <br>
Ooh, yeah <br>
Ooh <br>

Baby, I just don't get it <br>
Do you enjoy being hurt? <br>
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt <br>
You don't believe his stories <br>
You know that they're all lies <br>
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why <br>

If I was your man, baby, you'd <br>
Never worry bout what I do <br>
I'd be coming home back to you <br>
Every night, doin' you right <br>
You're the kind of woman, deserves good thangs <br>
Fistful of diamonds, hand full of rings <br>
Baby, you're a star, I just wanna show you, you are <br>

You should let me love you <br>
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need <br>
Baby, good love and protection <br>
Make me your selection <br>
Show you the way love's supposed to be <br>
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you <br>
Love you, yeah <br>

Your true beauty's description is so good that it hurts <br>
You're a dime plus ninety-nine, and it's a shame <br>
Don't even know what you're worth <br>
Everywhere you go they stop and stare <br>
'Cause you're bad and it shows <br>
From your head to your toes, out of control, baby, you don't know <br>

Never worry bout what I do <br>
I'd be coming home back to you <br>
Every night, doin' you right <br>
You're the kind of woman, deserves good thangs <br>
Fistful of diamonds, hand full of rings <br>
Baby, you're a star, I just wanna show you, you are <br>

You should let me love you <br>
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need <br>
Baby, good love and protection <br>
Make me your selection <br>
Show you the way love's supposed to be <br>
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you <br>
Yeah <br>

Baby, you should let me love you <br>
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need <br>
Baby, good love and protection <br>
Make me your selection <br>
Show you the way love's supposed to be <br>
Baby, you should let me love you</p>
