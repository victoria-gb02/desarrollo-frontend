    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City? <br>
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight you look so pretty <br>
Yes, you do <br>
Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true <br>
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance <br>
I'm right there, if you get lonely, give this song another listen <br>
Close your eyes<br>
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise, I'm by your side <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br> 
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me <br>
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard <br>
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar <br>
We'll have it good <br>
We'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good <br>
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say <br>
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away <br>
I'd write it all <br>
Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
A thousand miles seems pretty far <br>
But they've got planes and trains and cars <br>
I'd walk to you if I had no other way <br>
Our friends would all make fun of us <br>
And we'll just laugh along because <br>
We know that none of them have felt this way <br>
Delilah, I can promise you that by the time we get through <br>
The world will never ever be the same, and you're to blame <br>
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me <br>
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history <br>
Like I do <br>
You'll know it's all because of you <br>
We can do whatever we want to <br>
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you, this one's for you <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me <br>
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me <br>
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh <br>
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh</p>
